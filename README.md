This is the source code for [RDR](http://radar.technoculture.club), the collaborative trendwatching platform by [Techno Culture Club](http://technoculture.club). 

It uses [Telescope](http://telesc.pe)

Telescope is an open-source, real-time social news site built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com)

**Note:** Telescope is beta software. Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)
